                            The goal of this website is to provide Lincoln Literacy students with a hub to which they can find materials used in class.
                            This helps students that miss a class know what was covered so they don't fall behind. I hope that this also shows students that
                            we care deeply about providing the best English Learning experience.

                            Friday Decemeber 4th is the official release of version 1.0.0. This version makes all links functional and the about pages should be created. 
                            A mobile version of the website should also be functional although it might not look the best. The release was a bit rushed 
                            but I was too excited to not share this with the community I care so much about.

                            The best part about web development is that something can always be improved. I am very passionate about this project and will 
                            continue to update it until someone takes my computer away. The next update will focus on making the mobile side of the website as
                            smooth as it can be. With the help of you we can make this project fit the needs of many.

                            Last but not least I want to give a thanks to the people that helped me get this project off the floor. Thank you Abby for always
                            taking the time to listen to me talk about my very ambitious ideas and for providing ideas when I ran out of them. Thank you Mia for 
                            keeping me focused on what inspired me to make this website. Thank you to my sisters, Lesly and Maria,
                            for your unwavering support and always being there to help get back on my feet. Thank you to my wife Isabel for somehow looking excited after
                            seeing my website for the 100th time, I hope you are excited to see it 1000 more times.
